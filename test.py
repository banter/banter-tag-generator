           'liberty and individuality.” — Patrick Deneen It’s no secret to our regular '
           'readers that Strong Towns founder and president Chuck Marohn is an avid reader. '
           'In fact, every December, Chuck shares a list of highly recommended books from the'
           ' year that’s winding down—and in 2018, at the top of his list was Why Liberalism '
           'Failed by University of Notre Dame political scientist Patrick Deneen. If partisan '
           'alarm bells (or a partisan cheering section) just started ringing in your head, '
           'hold up—Deneen is not talking about liberalism in the sense of the modern left-right '
           'divide. He means liberalism in the sense of “the liberal Enlightenment,” or as Deneen '
           'puts it in this week’s episode of the Strong Towns Podcast, “the philosophical'
           ' political project of modernity.” The centuries-long liberal project treats society as a '
           'collection of autonomous individuals, and governments as social compacts whose primary '
           'purpose is to protect individual rights. Think, for example, of the Declaration of '
           'Independence: “That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, '
           'deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed.” The promise of liberalism '
           'is to free individuals from each other: from the tribal, religious, and communal bonds'
           ' that once ruled our lives. The problem, according to Deneen, is that there is a paradox '
           'at the heart of that project. The freer we are from traditional social structures, the more'
           ' powerful and encompassing must be the two mechanisms modern humans have invented to free us'
           ' from those structures: the state and the market. To the extent that there is a crisis of '
           'liberalism today—and the evidence for that lies in the political turmoil facing many Western '
           'countries—Deneen believes it may be because we feel more powerless than ever to meaningfully '
           'control or affect the course of either of those entities. Many of us treat national politics as largely '
           'a spectator sport, are cynical about the relevance or impact of voting or activism, and harbor a pervasive'
           ' sense that market forces, far from bring shared prosperity, are leaving many of our communities behind as'
           ' well. What’s the answer? Deneen has no five-point plan. But he does urge us to take a hard look at the value '
           'of community—of living lives that are embedded in a place, and not shying from the interpersonal obligation that '
           'this entails. Elite culture in America teaches us to “look for the exits,” says Deneen, but there is value and meaning to be found in forging the deep bonds of community in the place you are rooted, even when that is an uncomfortable or self-sacrificing thing to do. Deneen has his critics, but both his argument and its critiques fall outside of well-worn partisan ground. There is plenty here worth listening to and considering for Strong Towns advocates interested in the kind of localist revolution we talk often about: building deeply resilient, prosperous places from the ground up, through local action, without depending on either Washington or Wall Street for deliverance.

Dr. Friedman has studied not just the advantages and drawbacks associated with participation in sport as an activity, but also much broader sociological issues like how participation in sports helped children to increase what she calls Competitive Kid Capital and can actually impact the child's academic and lifelong success. So, Dr. Friedman received her Bachelor's Degree from Harvard and Master’s in Philosophy from the University of Cambridge and a Ph.D. in Sociology from Princeton University. She's currently a Visiting Assistant Professor of Education at Brown University and is the mother of a preschooler and a first grader. Welcome Dr. Friedman. Dr. Friedman:", "What's next now that Tigers have moved from underdog to big dog, blue blood status in the sport", "Serial killer Robert Hansen abducted and killed at least seventeen women and hunted many of them down in the Alaskan wilderness in the 1970s and 80s around Anchorage. This bakery owner and sport hunter was convicted in 1984 after confessing to killing seventeen women, mostly dancers and prostitutes, during a twelve-year reign of terror. Hansen led a very strange dual life - a happily married, donut-making father of two, while at the same time frequenting Anchorage's strip joints looking for young women to kidnap, rape, and then sometimes also hunt and kill.
